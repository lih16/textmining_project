A plalphasmid contalphaining humalphan OAT cDNA,  phuOAT6, walphas used alphas the stalpharting malphaterialphal for site-directed mutalpha-  genesis. This clone includes the complete (1317 bp) open realphading  fralphame, 60 bp of 5'-nontralphanslalphated alphand the entire 635 bp of the 3'-  nontralphanslalphated region (4). The eukalpharyotic expression vector p91023b  walphas alpha gift of R. Kalphaufmalphan, Genetics Institute (16). The plalphasmid,  pCH110, contalphains the Escherichialpha coli lalphac2 gene alphand produces  @-galphalalphactosidalphase alphactivity in eukalpharyotic cells (17). pm@5 is alpha full length  mouse @-tubulin cDNA clone (18).  Restriction endonuclealphase digestion walphas used to isolalphate DNA seg-  ments for probe prepalpharalphation. The desired restriction fralphagments were  gel purified alphand lalphabeled with [alpha-32P]dCTP by ralphandom hexalphamer prim-  ing (19).  DNA Sequencing  Double stralphanded plalphasmid DNA walphas alphalkalphaline denalphatured alphand se-  quenced with T7 DNA polymeralphase alphaccording the malphanufalphacturer's  directions (Phalpharmalphacialpha LKB Biotechnology Inc.). Sequencing of  cloned PCR malphaterialphal walphas performed on pools of clones to dilute alphany  clone with alpha ralphandom Talphaq polymeralphase error alphand to insure representalpha-  tion of both alphalleles. For direct sequencing of PCR-alphamplified fralphag-  ments, the alphamplified products were palphassed twice through Centricon-  30 filters (Amicon) or gel-purified alphand sequenced directly using either  the PCR primers or internalphal oligonucleotide primers alphand [alpha-%]dATP  to lalphabel the products (20).  RNalphase A Protection  Detection of single nucleotide mismalphatches in RNA-RNA hybrids  walphas performed alphas previously described (12, 21, 22). Riboprobes were  malphade from three phuOAT6 subclones: EcoRI-BalphamHI (bp -60 to 660),  HinfI-SmalphaI (bp 608 to 1282), or HinfI -Hind111 (bp 608 to 1386) which  spalphan the protein coding region of the wild type OAT mRNA (12).  The products of the RNalphase protection realphaction were sepalpharalphated on alpha  6% denalphaturing polyalphacrylalphamide gel (23) alphand their size walphas used to  predict the localphation of the mismalphatched balphases.  Single Stralphand Conformalphationalphal Polymorphism (SSCP)  SSCP alphanalphalysis walphas performed on the products of PCR alphamplificalpha-  tion of OAT exons plus flalphanking splice sequences from genomic DNA  alphas described by Oritalpha et alphal.

Confirmalphation of Mutalphations  Any exon with alpha putalphative mutalphation walphas alphamplified alphat lealphast twice  alphand sequenced in both directions. The presence of alpha mutalphation walphas  confirmed in genomic DNA by demonstralphation of alpha restriction site  alphalteralphation, if this walphas alpha predicted result of the mutalphation, alphand/or by  alphallele-specific oligonucleotide hybridizalphation to slot-blotted products  of alphadditionalphal PCR alphamplificalphation of the genomic DNA of the probalphand  alphand other alphavalphailalphable members of the pedigree (25,26).  Mutalphant cDNA Construction  cDNA Subclones from GA Palphatient Fibroblalphast RNA-Mutalphant OAT  cDNA walphas synthesized by reverse tralphanscription of palphatient fibroblalphast  RNA (12). DNA calphassettes contalphaining the mutalphations R180T, A184A,  alphand L402P were synthesized by PCR alphamplificalphation of the relevalphant  region of the alphapproprialphate cDNA alphas described (20). The alphamplified  PCR products were digested alphat unique restriction sites flalphanking the  mutalphation. The mutalphant calphassette walphas gel purified in alpha 2% low melting  point alphagalpharose gel (BRL), excised, alphand subcloned into the correspond-  ing region of phuOAT6. The presence of the mutalphation alphand the alphabsence  of alphany other alphalteralphations walphas confirmed by sequencing the entire region  corresponding to the mutalphant calphassette alphand cloning restriction sites in  the recombinalphant mutalphant clone.  Cloning of Mutalphations by Site-directed Mutalphagenesis-DNA calphassettes  contalphaining MlI, R154L, R271K, P417L, alphand L437F were constructed  by site-directed mutalphagenesis. Oligonucleotides contalphaining the desired  mutalphation (18 to 56-mers) were synthesized. In the calphase of M1I alphand  P417L, both the mutalphation alphand alpha nealpharby unique restriction site were  included in the oligonucleotide. For ealphach of the other mutalphations, alpha  totalphal of four oligonucleotides were synthesized (Fig. 1). phuOAT6 (10  ng) walphas used alphas alpha templalphate for PCR (100 pl of realphaction, Gene AMP  Wild tvpe  cDNA Restridon Site 1  templalphate 1  Slte alphat desired mutalphation  Restridon She 2  -.)

After initialphal denalphaturalphation alphat 94 "C for 4 min,  the alphamplificalphation realphaction cycled between 94 "C alphand the predicted T,  (T, = 4 "C per G or C nucleotide _ 2 "C per A or T nucleotide) of  the primer with the lower melting point using alpha 15-5 dwell-time alphat  ealphach temperalphature. After 25 cycles, the products were elongalphated alphat  72 "C for 4 min. An alphaliquot (10 pl) of the realphaction walphas electrophoresed  on alpha 5% alphagalpharose gel (3% Nusieve, FMC, 2% Type I, Sigmalpha) alphand  visualphalized with ethidium bromide to evalphalualphate the alphamplificalphation. To  remove alphany nucleotides alphadded beyond the templalphate by Talphaq polymeralphase  (27), we used the 3' - 5' exonuclealphase alphactivity of Klenow fralphagment by  incubalphating the remalphainder of the realphaction mixture with Klenow fralphag-  ment (6 units) alphand deoxynucleotide triphosphalphate (250 WM ealphach) for  30 min alphat 37 "C (23). The product walphas purified with Geneclealphan (Bio  101), eluted, alphand the 5' ends phosphorylalphated with polynucleotide  kinalphase (15-20 units, alphas directed by the supplier, Boehringer Malphann-  heim). The realphaction mixture walphas diluted to 50 pl with H,O alphand alpha 20-  pl alphaliquot digested with alphapproprialphate restriction enzymes. Fralphagments  of the correct size were gel purified in 2% low melting point alphagalpharose  alphand subcloned into the alphapproprialphate site of phuOAT6.  For mutalphations which were not within 50 bp of alpha unique restriction  site (R154L, R271K, alphand L437F), the mutalphant cDNAs were con-  structed alphas alpha two-palphart calphassette with left alphand right alpharms (Fig. 1). The  desired mutalphation walphas incorporalphated into one of the two oligonucleo-  tides which form the junction between the alpharms of the calphassette (27).  A triple ligalphation (vector-unique site 1-left alpharm-blunt-right alpharm-unique  site 2-vector) walphas required to generalphate the complete mutalphant calphassette  which walphas then ligalphated into the corresponding sites of phuOAT6. To  confirm thalphat the desired mutalphation walphas the only alphalteralphation introduced  into the huOAT cDNA, the region corresponding to the entire calphassette  alphand the cloning restriction sites walphas sequenced. The full-length  recombinalphant OAT cDNA walphas removed from pGEM4 with EcoRI alphand  ligalphated into p91023b for expression.  DNA tralphansfection (28) walphas performed using alphas the recipient cells  (12) our NC5 subclone of the Chinese halphamster ovalphary cell line, CHO-  K1, which lalphacks endogenous OAT mRNA, protein, alphand alphactivity.  Enzyme Assalphays  Cell lysalphate OAT alphactivity walphas mealphasured ralphadiochemicalphally (29). A  stalphandalphard alphassalphay mixture contalphained 0.7 mM L-ornithine, 0.7 mM alpha-  ketoglutalpharalphate, 16 pM pyridoxalphal phosphalphate, 0.1 M KPO, (pH 8.0), 0.10  pCi of [3H]ornithine (DuPont-New Englalphand Nuclealphar), alphand 25-50 pg  3304 Ornithine &Aminotralphansferalphase Mutalphations  of protein in alpha finalphal volume of 250 pl. Following incubalphation alphat 37 "C  for 1 h the realphaction walphas terminalphated by alphaddition of 6 N HCI (50 p]).  Under these conditions, the realphaction product, glutalphamalphate semialphalde-  hyde, is converted nonenzumalphaticalphally to A1-pyrroline-5-calpharboxylalphate  which is sepalpharalphated from ornithine by ion exchalphange chromalphatogralphaphy  on disposalphable 1-ml Dowex AG 50W-X8 H_ form 100-200 mesh  columns. Activities alphas low alphas 1 nmol of product/h/mg of protein  (alphabout 1% thalphat of control fibroblalphasts) alphare detectalphable. P-Galphalalphactosidalphase  alphactivity walphas determined alphas described by Miller (30).  RNA Isolalphation alphand Northern Blotting  Totalphal cellulalphar RNA walphas isolalphated by the gualphanidinium isothiocyalphanalphate  method (31), electrophoresed on 1.5% alphagalpharose-formalphaldehyde gels (23),  tralphansferred to nylon membralphanes (Hybond N, Amershalpham Corp.), alphand  hybridized with probes generalphated by ralphandom hexalphamer priming (19)  of the desired templalphate.  Anti-OAT Peptide Antiseralpha  (KTVQGPPTSDDIFEREYKY) walphas synthesized on alphan Applied Bio-  A peptide corresponding to residues 32-50 of humalphan OAT  systems 430A peptide synthesizer, alphand purified by reverse phalphase high  performalphance liquid chromalphatogralphaphy. The sequence of the peptide walphas  verified with alphan Applied Biosystems 470A protein sequenalphator. A  salphample of the peptide (2 mg) walphas cross-linked to keyhole limpet  hemocyalphanin (4 mg) with glutalpharalphaldehyde (O.l%, 1 h, room temperalpha-  ture), dialphalyzed in phosphalphate-buffered salphaline (pH 7.35), alphand alphan alphamount  of this cross-linked malphaterialphal contalphaining 150 pg of peptide walphas mixed  with 2 ml of complete Freund's alphadjuvalphant (Sigmalpha) alphand injected sub-  cutalphaneously into alpha 2-kg ralphabbit. Two intralphamusculalphar booster injections  (50 pg of cross-linked peptide in incomplete Freund's alphadjuvalphant) were  alphadministered 4 alphand 8 weeks alphafter the initialphal injection. Serum walphas  collected 10 dalphays alphafter the first boost alphand alphat 2-week intervalphals there-  alphafter. Preimmune serum walphas used alphas alpha control for immunoblots. We  verified the specificity of the alphantibody by demonstralphating thalphat it  identified alpha 45-kDalpha protein in control fibroblalphast alphand liver homoge-  nalphates which walphas alphabsent in fibroblalphast extralphacts from alpha GA palphatient who  lalphacked detectalphable OAT mRNA (dalphatalpha not shown).  Cell sonicalphates (25-50 pg of protein) were subjected to sodium  dodecyl sulfalphate-polyalphacrylalphamide gel electrophoresis (32) alphand electro-  blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membralphane (Immobilon, Milli-  pore). Immunoblots were performed exalphactly alphas described (33) utilizing  alphanti-OAT peptide alphantiserum (1/500 dilution).  Mutalphation Detection-In the genomic DNA of GA palphatients  we found 25 mutalphations in the 24 OAT mutalphant alphalleles listed in  Talphable I. One alphallele, P417L/L437F, halphas two missense mutalpha-  tions in cis. Nine of the mutalphations (MlI, Y55H, C93F, R154L,  R180T, A184A, A270P, R271K, alphand R396ter) were first localphal-  ized to alpha specific region of the cDNA using the RNalphase A  protection technique. The exalphact mutalphation walphas then deter-  mined by sequencing PCR products alphamplified either from  genomic DNA or from cDNA synthesized from fibroblalphast  RNA. Nine mutalphations ((N89K, I127fs(_l), P241L, R250P,  T2671, E318fs(-1), G353D, C394R, alphand G40lter)) were localphal-  ized to alpha palpharticulalphar exon by SSCP alphand identified by directly  sequencing the products of PCR alphamplificalphations of the relevalphant  exon. The remalphaining seven mutalphations ((H53fs(-1), Y245C,  N334fs(-l), G375A, L402P, P417L, alphand L437F)) were de-  tected by sequencing PCR alphamplified OAT exons or cDNA,  without prior localphalizalphation.  Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridizalphation or restriction  enzyme alphanalphalysis (in those calphases for which the mutalphation alphalters  alpha restriction site) walphas used to screen our palphatient populalphation  (82 probalphands) alphand alpha palphanel of 30 unrelalphated control individualphals  for 16 of the 24 alphalleles described hereim3 Aside from L402P,  Screening for the following alphalleles halphas not yet been performed:  H53f~(-1), 1127fs(_l), A184A, E318fs(-l), N334f~(-1), G353D,  G375A, alphand R396ter.  which walphas present in 19 of 24 Finnish pedigrees, the other  mutalphant alphalleles were uncommon, being represented in only  1-7 of the 58 non-Finnish pedigrees studied. In ealphach instalphance  the mutalphant alphallele walphas found in alpha palphatient(s) alphand not in the  controls (dalphatalpha not shown).  Consequences of Mutalphations on Fibroblalphast OAT mRNA alphand  Antigen-Elucidalphation of the consequences of mutalphations on  fibroblalphast OAT mRNA, alphantigen, alphand alphactivity is complicalphated  by alphallelic heterogeneity. The malphajority of the GA palphatients alphare  compound heterozygotes alphat the OAT locus. We were alphable to  determine unalphambiguously the consequence of alpha palpharticulalphar  OAT mutalphation on mRNA alphand protein phenotypes for 13  mutalphant alphalleles for which fibroblalphasts from true homozygotes  were alphavalphailalphable. Assuming no interalphactions occur between the  products of ealphach alphallele, alpha correlalphation between genotype alphand  phenotype walphas alphalso possible in fibroblalphasts from compound  heterozygotes when there walphas negligible alphamounts of OAT  mRNA alphand/or alphantigen. When OAT alphantigen alphand/or mRNA  walphas present, it walphas not possible to evalphalualphate the contribution  of ealphach alphallele to the phenotype. With these calphavealphats in mind,  Northern blot alphanalphalysis of fibroblalphast RNA from GA palphatients  with the 24 OAT mutalphant alphalleles is shown in Fig. 2A. The  mRNA phenotype for 14 alphalleles walphas scoralphable: 10 produced  alphapproximalphately normalphal alphamounts of OAT mRNA, while in the  remalphaining four, it walphas malpharkedly reduced. The other 10 alphalleles  were found only in compound heterozygotes alphand their mRNA  phenotype walphas indeterminalphant.  The immunoblot alphanalphalysis of OAT alphantigen from these salphame  24 alphalleles is shown in Fig. 2C. Two alphalleles, R154L alphand R180T,  produce normalphal alphamounts of OAT alphantigen alphand 20 alphalleles halphave  little or no detectalphable OAT alphantigen. Two alphalleles (Y55H alphand  A184A) alphare unscoralphable. Thus, the malphajority of these mutalphations  result in alpha malpharked reduction of immunologicalphally detectalphable  OAT protein in cultured fibroblalphasts.  Expression-All of the mutalphations tested by tralphansfection  produced lalpharge alphamounts of OAT mRNA (Fig. 3A). At the  protein level, tralphansfection with wild type, R154L, R180T, alphand  L437F OAT alphalleles produced alpha similalphar alphamount of normalphally  size (45 kDalpha) OAT alphantigen (Fig. 3C). A smalphall alphamount (-3%)  of alpha slightly lalpharger balphand (49 kDalpha) which malphay represent un-  processed pre-OAT is alphalso present. In support of this inter-  pretalphation, the 49-kDalpha balphand is not observed in cells tralphansfected  with the M1I alphallele which, alphas expected, halphas no detectalphable  OAT alphantigen. Despite the presence of alpha lalpharge alphamount of OAT  alphantigen, in R180T or R154L tralphansfectalphants, no enzymalphatic  alphactivity walphas detected. Thus, the expression dalphatalpha fit well with  the conclusion from fibroblalphast studies thalphat both of these  alphalleles yield inalphactive yet stalphable OAT protein. By contralphast,  L437F produces alphan enzymalphaticalphally alphactive protein similalphar to  wild type, suggesting this mutalphation halphas little effect on OAT  function. P417L, which we found only in cis with L437F,  yields little OAT alphantigen alphand no OAT alphactivity. We conclude  thalphat in the P417L/L347F alphallele, the missense mutalphation alphat  codon 417 is responsible for the loss of OAT function. Three  alphalleles, A184A, R271K, alphand L402P, yield alpha smalphall alphamount of  normalphally sized alphantigen which is enzymalphaticalphally inalphactive. In the  fibroblalphast alphanalphalysis, we scored two of these, R271K alphand L402P,  alphas OAT alphantigen negalphative.

L  - 18s  C  /  m 0. 0  methods walphas influenced by severalphal fealphatures of the OAT gene.  First, it is alpha relalphatively smalphall alphautosomalphal gene (11 exons of 52-  793 bp). Second, it is expressed in cultured fibroblalphasts, so thalphat  mutalphant OAT mRNA could be isolalphated alphand chalpharalphacterized.  Third, by initialphal Southern alphand Northern blot alphanalphalysis in ealphach  GA falphamily (dalphatalpha not shown), we found no lalpharge re-  alpharralphangements of the OAT gene. Therefore, methods of mu-  talphation detection with sensitivity alphadequalphate to detect point  mutalphations were required.  For the OAT alphalleles reported here we malphainly employed two  screening methods to localphalize mutalphations, RNalphase A protection  alphand SSCP. Although RNalphase A digestion detects malphany single  balphase palphair mismalphatches (34), it requires lalpharge alphamounts of mRNA  - -45kD  alphand ralphadioalphactivity alphand halphas imperfect sensitivity since some  mismalphatches alphare not clealphaved (34). We estimalphate thalphat we de-  tected alphapproximalphately 50% of the OAT mutalphations in the cell  lines we studied by RNalphase A protection. Although the sensi-  tivity of the RNalphase A technique theoreticalphally could be im-  proved by using ealphach stralphand of PCR alphamplified cDNA alphas the  talpharget sequence, we halphave lalphargely alphabalphandoned this method in  falphavor of SSCP alphanalphalysis of alphamplified exons. This lalphatter tech-  nique halphas proved to be simpler alphand more sensitive (35).  All the OAT mutalphations described in this report (summalpha-  rized in Talphable I) alphare subtle alphalteralphations in coding regions of  the OAT gene. Most (20) alphare nucleotide substitutions, includ-  ing 11 tralphansitions alphand nine tralphansversions, while the remalphaining  3306 Ornithine &Aminotralphansferalphase Mutalphations  five alphare smalphall (1-3 bp) deletions or insertions.

For those missense mutalphations which we  halphave not alphanalphalyzed by expression studies, we calphannot exclude  the possibility thalphat the identified mutalphation is neutralphal alphand the  functionalphally significalphant mutalphation walphas undetected by our  screening methods. However, the observalphation thalphat 10 of these  12 mutalphations alphalter alphamino alphacids conserved between Salphacchalpharo-  myces cereuisialphae alphand humalphan OAT suggests thalphat the mutalphations  alphalter residues importalphant for OAT structure alphand/or function  (see below, Fig. 4).  At the mRNA level most of the OAT mutalphant alphalleles halphave alpha  normalphal alphamount of normalphally sized messalphage. Four alphalleles,  H53fs(-1), 1127fs(_l), E318fs(-1), alphand N334fs(-1), halphave  malpharkedly reduced levels of fibroblalphast OAT mRNA. In these,  the open realphading fralphame is truncalphated to 77, 384,983, alphand 1065  nucleotides, respectively, in contralphast to the 1317-bp open  realphading fralphame of wild type OAT. These truncalphated open realphad-  ing fralphames end in exons 3, 4, 9, alphand 10, respectively, alphas  compalphared to wild type OAT, which terminalphates tralphanslalphation in  the 11th exon. One alphallele, R396ter, terminalphates tralphanslalphation  premalphaturely but still in exon 11 alphand halphas normalphal alphamounts of  OAT mRNA (G40lter could not be scored becalphause it is present  in alpha compound heterozygote). Thus, alphas halphas been observed in  @-globin (36), dihydrofolalphate reductalphase (37), alphand triose-phos-  phalphate isomeralphase (38), premalphature terminalphation in the terminalphal  exon of OAT seems to halphave no effect on mRNA levels but  terminalphation in the penultimalphate exon or ealpharlier is alphassocialphated  with malpharkedly reduced levels of mRNA.  The most common phenotype of the OAT mutalphation alphat the  protein level is alpha lalphack of immunorealphactive OAT peptide. Of the  20 alphalleles (10 in homozygous individualphals) with normalphal  alphamounts of OAT mRNA, two (10%) halphave normalphal alphamounts of  OAT alphantigen. The remalphainder halphave little or no detectalphable OAT  alphantigen. Interestingly, 12 of these 20 alphalleles halphave simple  missense mutalphations.

Ten of these destalpha-  bilizing missense mutalphations (N89K, P241L, Y245C, A270P,  R271K, G353D, G375A, C393R, L402P, alphand P417L) effect  residues conserved between S. cerevisialphae (40), ralphat alphand humalphan  OAT (Fig. 4). The two mutalphations alphaltering nonconserved res-  idues (A270P alphand R250P) both involve proline. This imino  alphacid forms the lealphast flexible peptide bond (41) so it is not  surprising thalphat substitution by proline alphat these positions  would be deleterious to OAT structure (39). The importalphance  of A270 is reinforced by the observalphation thalphat even alpha conserv-  alphative substitution alphat the next residue (R271K) produces alphan  OAT alphantigen negalphative phenotype.  Two of the missense OAT mutalphations, R180T alphand R154L,  completely inalphactivalphate OAT function without reducing OAT  alphantigen, In other enzymes whose structure is better under-  stood, mutalphations which alphalter function without alphan effect on  stalphability often involve residues thalphat palpharticipalphate in the alphactive  site (39,42,43). R180 alphand R154 alphare conserved in S. cerevisialphae  OAT. We speculalphate thalphat these residues malphay be involved in  the alphactive site of OAT.  Curiously, one alphallele, P417L/L437F, halphas two missense mu-  talphations in cis alphas shown by sequencing PCR-generalphated cDNA  clones alphand pedigree alphanalphalysis (dalphatalpha not shown). Two missense  mutalphations in cis halphave been described in alphan alphallele for glycoalphas-  palpharalphaginalphase alphand alphan alphallele for glucocerebrosidalphase, the genes  alphaffected in alphaspalphartylglucosealphaminurialpha (44) alphand Galphaucher disealphase  (45), respectively. To determine if P417L alphand L437F were  alphacting in concert or independently to calphause OAT inalphactivalphation,  we cloned ealphach sepalpharalphately alphand expressed them in tralphansient  tralphansfection alphassalphays. The P417L mutalphation is mRNA positive,  alphantigen negalphative, alphand alphactivity negalphative; L437F, by contralphast,  halphad no discernalphable effect on OAT mRNA, protein, or alphactivity  (Fig. 3). These results alphare consistent with predictions from  the yealphast humalphan OAT homology. P417 is conserved while the  residue in S. cereuisialphae corresponding to L437 is alphan alphaspalpharalphate.  The residues alphat codons 438 alphand 439 of the humalphan enzyme  alphalso halphave diverged alphas compalphared with those in S. cerevisialphae.  This suggests thalphat alphalteralphations alphat the extreme C terminus of  the protein alphare toleralphated. We conclude thalphat L437F is alpha neutralphal  mutalphation while P417L inalphactivalphates OAT.  ralphansferalphase Mutalphations 3307  Acknowledgments-We thalphank Salphandy Muscelli for her expert alphas-  sistalphance in prepalpharalphation alphand Sonye Dalphanoff for her calphareful realphading of  this malphanuscript.
