itelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal
recessive renal tubular disorder character-
d by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypo-
gnesemia, and hypocalciuria.

GS is caused
inactivating mutations in the SLC12A3 gene
coding the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride
a-Cl) cotransporter (NCC) of the distal convo-
ed tubule (DCT).

To date, more than 100
tations in the SLC12A3 gene were identified.

wever, the relationship between mutations and
molecular mechanism of the disease was not
t identified.
Before the establishment of mutation analysis
the SLC12A3 gene, the diagnosis of GS was
pendent on clinical and biochemical features
d was supplemented by results of clearance
dies using thiazide and furosemide in se-
ence, which was cumbersome and had no
ablished cutoff values.

Genotyping all pa-
nts with suspected GS is the best way to
gnose the disease, but is impractical because

present time.

Moreover, a genetic abnormal-
ity other than SLC12A3 gene mutations may
cause similar clinical features.

An unusual de-
gree of phenotypic variation is not uncommon in
patients with GS.

These phenotypic varia-
tions can be explained by the different mecha-
nisms by which mutations reduce or abolish

the degree or pattern of NCC expression in
DCT. Therefore, mutation analysis of the
C12A3 gene might not be the ultimate diagnos-
method for GS. For a definite diagnosis and
derstanding of the pathophysiologic mecha-
m of GS, it is necessary to investigate the
tual expression of NCC in patients’ renal tis-
es.
Recently, it was shown that apical renal so-
m transporters could be detected in urine by
ans of immunoblot, and these urinary trans-
rters might be used as a biomarker for a
ecific disease.

The aims of this study are to
lineate the relationship between SLC12A3 gene
tation and NCC expression in renal tissues
m patients with GS and evaluate the potential
e of urinary NCC as a biomarker for the
ferential diagnosis of GS. In the present study,
investigated relations among NCC protein
pression in DCTs of renal tissue, urinary excre-
n of NCC, and SLC12A3 gene mutations in
tients with GS diagnosed by using clinical and
chemical characteristics.
METHODS
bjects
ix patients with a diagnosis of GS by means of clinical
tures and biochemical parameters and 1 patient with
reptitious vomiting were enrolled in this study. The
trol patient with surreptitious vomiting flatly denied his
iting or laxative use at first. Therefore, a misdiagnosis of
was made despite low urinary chloride excretion in
tion to urinary sodium excretion. During the follow-up
iod, he admitted that he vomited regularly and used
atives for fear of obesity. A family history of salt craving,
otension, nocturia, polyuria, or paralysis/paresthesia was
vailable for all patients. Clearance studies using diuret-
, mutation analysis for the SLC12A3 gene, and immuno-
t for urinary NCC were performed. Western blot for
nary NCC also was performed in 8 healthy volunteers.

arance Studies
enal clearance studies were performed according to the
tocol described elsewhere.

Patients drank water (20
/kg of body weight) after an overnight fast, followed byavenous infusion of 0.45% saline solution at a rate of 40
/h. Urine volume and urine osmolality were checked
ry 20 minutes by using a cryoscopic osmometer (Osmo-
t 030-D; Gonotec, Berlin, Germany). Upon every void-
, patients drank additional water, in an amount equal to
ne volume plus 20 mL. When urine flow reached its
ximal level, plasma and urine samples were obtained. For
thiazide-loading test, 100 mg of hydrochlorothiazide was
inistered orally to patients. For the loop diuretic loading
t, 40 mg of furosemide was administered intravenously to
ients. Water-loading, thiazide-loading, and furosemide-
ding tests were performed in sequence on the same day.
arance data were obtained when urine flow reached
ximal. Clearances were calculated as follows: maximal
e-water clearance (CH

O)   (1   Uosm/Posm)   V;
oride clearance (CCl)   UCl   V/PCl; and distal frac-
al chloride reabsorption (DFCR)   CH

l), where Uosm is urine osmolality, Posm is plasma
olality, V is urinary flow (milliliters per minute), UCl is
nary chloride concentration (milliequivalents per liter),
PCl is plasma chloride concentration (milliequivalents
liter).
tation Analysis
or SLC12A3 gene analysis, both RNA and genomic
A were isolated from peripheral-blood cells. RNA was
erse transcribed to complementary DNA, and 4 overlap-
g complementary DNA fragments covering most parts of
coding sequences of the SLC12A3 gene were amplified
using nested polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and
ectly sequenced. For exons 1, 2, and 3, which were not
ered by this nested reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR, and
any fragments that failed to get good results by using
ted RT-PCR, the corresponding exon sequences were
lyzed by using genomic DNA PCR and direct sequenc-
. Mutations detected using nested RT-PCR also were
firmed through direct sequencing of the PCR product of
corresponding exon from genomic DNA. Sequences of
mers used in the nested RT-PCR are as follows: for
t-round PCR; sense 5=-AGCACCTTCTGCATGCG-
C-3= and antisense 5=-GATGGCGTAGGCCAGCAG-
A-3=, sense 5=-GACCAGCTGTACCCACTGATC-3= and

RESULTS
inical and Biochemical Data
All subjects had hypokalemia, metabolic alka-
is, hypereninemia, and increased plasma aldo-
rone levels. All except patient B had hypocal-
ria, and all except patients B and C had
pomagnesemia. Serum magnesium levels in
tient B and C were 1.6 mg/dL (0.66 mmol/L)
d 1.5 mg/dL (0.62 mmol/L), respectively; these
re in the low-normal range. The magnesium
el of the control patient (patient G) was within
rmal range, and urinary chloride excretion was
creased compared with urinary sodium excre-
n. The diagnosis of GS was favored by clinical
tures, patient age, the absence of overt poly-
a, and the presence of hypocalciuria and/or
pomagnesemia in patients A to F (Table 1).
nal Clearance Study
Chloride clearance was increased in all sub-
ts after furosemide loading. DFCR signifi-
ntly decreased after furosemide administra-
n. However, these 2 parameters were not
ected significantly by hydrochlorothiazide ad-
nistration (Table 2) in patients with GS. Al-
ugh DFCR was slightly decreased in patients
B, and F after hydrochlorothiazide administra-
n, the decrease was less than that in the control
tient. In the control patient, minimal urine
molality was less than that of patients with GS,
d change in DFCR after hydrochlorothiazide
ministration was greater than that of patients
th GS. However, discrimination between pa-
nts with GS and the patient with surreptitious
miting was not clear because of the unavailabil-
of a cutoff value.
tation Analysis
Six different sequence variants in SLC12A3
re detected in 6 patients (patients A to F).

Urinary NCC in Gitelman Syndrome 771tients (patients A to F). All 6 sequence variants
re not detected in 75 control Korean subjects
0 alleles), except for p.Thr180Lys, which was
tected in 1 control subject.We could not exam-
the frequencies of these variants in family
mbers of probands.
Because we could not test functional effects of
4 missense mutants by using a heterologous
pression system, we analyzed biochemical ef-
ts of the 4 mutations by using 2 computer
grams, SIFT and PolyPhen.
21,22
Both the
FT and Polyphen programs suggested that
er976Phe may affect protein function. The
lyphen program predicts both p.Asp848Asn
d p.Ile988Thr to be “possibly damaging,”
ereas the SIFT program predicts this substitu-
n would be tolerated by the NCC protein. On
basis of the available information, we cannot
e out the possibility that these variants contrib-
to disease susceptibility. A p.Thr180Lys sub-
tution was reported first as a possibly patho-
nic mutation.
7
However, a later functional study
owed that this variation was a polymor-
ism.
23
Considering that the patient with this
tation (patient B) had clinical and biochemi-
l features compatible with GS, it is possible
t we did not find mutations that could not be
tected by using current mutation analysis meth-
s. The intronic mutation in patient D can cause
normal splicing and should be pathogenic.
wever, we cannot predict the possible effect
p.Gln95del on protein function at the moment.
Up to 40% of patients are found to have
terozygous mutations in the SLC12A3 gene,
her than compound heterozygous or homozy-
us mutations.
4,24
Only 1 mutant allele was
ntified in 3 of the 6 patients, compatible with
vious reports.
4,24
Several explanations for this
ficit of detection are possible. Because of the
hnical limitation of mutation analysis, only
on and exon-boundary mutations could be
tected, and mutations within promoter regions,
ulatory 5=-untranslated regions, 3=-polyadenyl-
d tails, and deep introns could not be assessed.
other gene, such as CLCNKB, may be in-
lved in GS. Unavailability of mutation analy-
of CLCNKB is one of the limitations of this
dy.
There could be 5 mechanisms by which
tations reduce or abolish transporter activ-
.
4,12,19,20,25,26
A mutation could: (1) impairtein synthesis, (2) impair protein process-
,
12,20
(3) interfere with insertion of an other-
se functional protein into the plasma mem-
ne,
12,19
(4) modify functional properties of
cotransporter,
26
and (5) accelerate protein
oval or degradation. All mechanisms except
fifth were already mentioned in GS.
Some missense mutations show partial func-
n, whereas some mutations in SLC12A3 lead
complete loss of expression and cotransporter
ivity.
12,20,25
Immunoreactivity to NCC at the
ical membrane of the DCT was not observed
tientsA and C) or decreased (patients B, D, E,
d F). From these immunohistochemistry re-
lts, we could speculate that the second or third
chanism might be the cause of decreased
C expression. Discrepancies between results
urine immunoblot and immunohistochemistry
patients A and C could exclude the possibility
the first mechanism in our patients. However,
ctional analysis of the expressed mutants us-
a heterologous expression system should be
uired to confirm the mechanisms by which
tations regulate transporter activity and/or ex-
ssion.
Serum magnesium levels were not decreased
2 of the 6 patients (patients B and C), and
-hour urinary calcium excretion was not de-
ased in 1 patient (patient B). Hypocalciuria
d hypomagnesemia are not always prerequi-
e to GS and might change during the life cycle
a given patient.
17,27
Moreover, the 2 patients
re being administered potassium and magne-
m supplements at the time of study, which
uld influence results. Except for these bio-
emical abnormalities, we could not discrimi-
te the phenotypic difference in patients accord-
to mutations or NCC expression in renal
sue. We also could not find a relation between
e of mutation and NCC expression in tissues.
is result might originate from the limits of this
dy. First, the number of patients was too small
establish meaningful discrimination. Second,
r inclusion criteria were limited to only pa-
nts who had typical clinical features of GS. In
dition, only 2 of the 6 patients had a homozy-
us mutation in this study. Patients with a
mozygous mutation would be more suitable
investigating the relationships between phe-
type and a specific NCC mutation.

Joo et al772The differential diagnosis of GS depends on
nical features of the patient, a detailed account
the patient’s history, measurement of serum
d urine electrolytes, detection of diuretics in
ne, and clearance studies. However, pheno-
e variability, patient denial of medication his-
y, and the cumbersomeness of a clearance
dy sometimes make the differential diagnosis
nfusing. Despite its physiological background,
re are no standard protocol and cutoff values
abnormal results in a renal clearance study.
though the patient with surreptitious vomiting
owed a different pattern of response to hydro-
lorothiazide administration, the difference was
t impressive enough to interpret the result
nfidently. A simple, noninvasive, and reliable
gnostic method is required.
Although it recently was suggested that analy-
of urinary membrane fractions might provide
ninvasive information about the pathophysi-
gical state of renal tubules,
13,14

in a specific patient population was made.
eliminary studies were done to determine the
ount of loading samples sufficient for clear
C bands in healthy volunteers. Two milli-
ms of urine creatinine equivalent was enough

ta not shown), and the presence of NCC in
rmal urine was ascertained in urine from
althy volunteers by means of immunoblot (Fig
). Bands in the higher molecular-weight range
s believed to represent NCCmultimers, which
ght be formed through the formation of mul-
esicular bodies, subsequent fusion with the
ical plasma membrane, and excreted into the
nary space by the process of exocytosis.

inary NCC excretion was markedly decreased
patients with GS, which discriminates patients
m healthy controls and a patient with surrepti-
us vomiting. Urine AQP2 signals in patients
th GS could represent that all patients were in
olume-depleted condition, and at least AQP2
pression is regulated normally in the collecting
ct.
16
Urinary NCC band density in patient G was
ry intense. Considering that urinary chloride
cretion was low, minimal urine osmolality was
, DFCR was decreased after hydrochlorothia-
e administration, and no mutation of SLC12A3
s detected, a diagnosis other than GS wasspected. However, phenotype variability of
, the patient’s denial of vomiting, no refer-
ce values for the clearance study, and limita-
n in the method of mutation analysis made the
gnosis confusing. Urinary NCC was the most
tinguishing finding that discriminated this pa-
nt from the other subjects.
Results of urine immunoblot were similar to
se of immunohistochemistry, but did not ex-
tly represent NCC expression in the DCT.
ese discrepancies might be caused by: (1) the
ssibility that analysis of immunohistochemis-
on biopsy samples is subject to technical
ors and observational variations, and (2) differ-
t sensitivities of the 2 tests. We confirmed that
nary NCC excretion was markedly decreased,
t the regulatory mechanism for its urinary
cretion is yet to be investigated.
In conclusion, NCC protein expression in the
inal surface of the DCT from patients with
was decreased, and no relation between NCC
pression and type of mutation in the SLC12A3
ne was found. Analysis of urinary NCC might
a promising tool for the differential diagnosis
GS. Additional studies with a large number of
re defined patients to evaluate the clinical
efulness of urinary NCC excretion are neces-
y.
