Ornithine  b-aminotransferase is a  nuclear-encoded 
mitochondrial  matrix  enzyme  which catalyzes the re- 
versible  interconversion  of  ornithine and a-ketoglu- 
tarate  to  glutamate  semialdehyde and  glutamate.  In- 
herited  deficiency  of  ornithine  b-aminotransferase re-
sults in  ornithine  accumulation and a  characteristic 
chorioretinal  degeneration, gyrate atrophy  of  the  cho- 
roid and retina. We have  surveyed  the  ornithine 
&aminotransferase  genes of gyrate atrophy  patients 
for mutations.  Using  a variety of techniques, we dis- 
covered and molecularly characterized 21 newly 
recognized  ornithine  b-aminotransferase alleles. We 
determined the consequences of these and three 
previously  described  mutations on ornithine b-amino- 
transferase mRNA, antigen, and  enzyme activity in 
cultured  fibroblasts.  The  majority (20/24) of  these al- 
leles produce  normal  amounts  of  normally sized  orni- 
thine  &aminotransferase mRNA. By  contrast,  only 2/ 
24 had  normal  amounts  of ornithine  b-aminotrans- 
ferase antigen.  Reproducing  these  mutations by site- 
directed  mutagenesis and expressing  the  mutant  orni- 
thine  b-aminotransferase  in  Chinese  hamster  ovary 
cells confirms  that several of  these  mutations  inacti- 
vate ornithine  b-aminotransferase  and  cause gyrate 
atrophy  in  these  patients. 
Ornithine  &aminotransferase (OAT?; ~-ornithine:P-oxo- 
acid  aminotransferase;  EC 2.6.1.13) is a mitochondrial matrix 
enzyme which catalyzes the reversible conversion of ornithine 
and  a-ketoglutarate  to glutamate semialdehyde and gluta- 
mate. OAT monomers are synthesized as 49-kDa precursors 
and processed to 45 kDa upon entry  into  the mitochondrial

form of the enzyme (1). In humans, deficiency of OAT causes 
gyrate atrophy of the choroid and  retina (GA), an autosomal 
recessive trait characterized by ornithine accumulation and a 
distinctive  chorioretinal degeneration. We and others have 
cloned and sequenced a  near full length  human OAT cDNA 
(2-4), determined the  structural gene organization, and 
mapped it to 10q26 (5, 6). Although the amino acid sequence 
of many  a-aminotransferases is known, OAT and, recently 
g1utamate:succinic semialdehyde transaminase (4-aminobu- 
tyrate transaminase;  EC 2.6.1.19) (7) are  the only Q-amino- 
transferases whose primary sequence is available (8). Thirteen

We used a  variety of techniques including RNase A  protec- 
tion, single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) 
analysis, and  the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with direct 
sequencing to detect  mutations in  the OAT genes of patients 
with GA. Herein we describe 21 newly  recognized OAT mu- 
tations  and present biochemical and functional  characteriza- 
tion of these  and  three  other OAT mutant alleles which we 
have previously reported (9, 12). Our results identify amino

EXPERIMENTAL  PROCEDURES 
OAT  Allele Nomenclature 
OAT missense alleles are designated using the single letter abbre- 
viation for amino acids and codon numbers with codon 1 correspond- 
ing to  the initiation methionine. The first  letter and  the following 
number indicate the normal residue and codon number, respectively. 
For missense mutations the final  letter indicates the replacement 
residue. Nonsense mutations  are indicated by the suffix ?ter? follow- 
ing the codon number, e.g., G40lter. Small (1-2 bp) deletions or 
insertions are indicated by ?fs? (for frameshift)  after the codon 
number followed by the number of bases inserted or deleted, e.g. 
1127fs(+l). The suffix ?A? indicates deletion of a single codon, e.g. 
A184A. 
Cell Culture 
Culture of patient  and control fibroblasts, Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO-K1) and Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cell lines was as de- 
scribed (12). TFC7 is a CHO subline expressing wild type human 
OAT activity. This cell line was isolated by selection for proline 
prototrophy (15) after  transfection with a human OAT expression 
vector.

Ornithine &Aminotransferase Mutations

Plasmids, Probes, and Cloning  Vectors 
Unless otherwise indicated pGEM4 (Promega) was  used for all 
cloning manipulations. A plasmid containing human OAT cDNA, 
phuOAT6, was  used as the  starting material for site-directed  muta- 
genesis. This clone includes the complete (1317 bp) open reading 
frame, 60 bp of 5'-nontranslated and  the entire 635 bp of the 3'- 
nontranslated region (4). The eukaryotic expression vector p91023b 
was a gift of R. Kaufman, Genetics Institute (16). The plasmid, 
pCH110, contains the Escherichia coli lac2 gene and produces 
@-galactosidase activity in eukaryotic cells (17). pm@5 is a full length 
mouse @-tubulin cDNA clone (18). 
Restriction endonuclease digestion was used to isolate DNA  seg- 
ments for probe preparation. The desired restriction  fragments were 
gel purified and labeled with [a-32P]dCTP by random hexamer prim- 
ing (19). 
DNA Sequencing 
Double stranded plasmid DNA  was alkaline denatured and se- 
quenced with T7 DNA polymerase according the manufacturer's 
directions (Pharmacia  LKB Biotechnology Inc.). Sequencing of 
cloned PCR material was performed on pools of clones to dilute  any 
clone with a random Taq polymerase error and  to insure  representa- 
tion of both alleles. For direct sequencing of PCR-amplified frag- 
ments, the amplified products were passed twice through Centricon- 
30 filters (Amicon) or gel-purified and sequenced directly using either 
the PCR primers or internal oligonucleotide primers and  [a-%]dATP 
to label the products (20). 
RNase A Protection 
Detection of single nucleotide mismatches in RNA-RNA hybrids 
was performed as previously described (12,  21, 22). Riboprobes were 
made from three phuOAT6 subclones: EcoRI-BamHI (bp -60 to 660), 
HinfI-SmaI (bp 608 to 1282), or HinfI -Hind111 (bp 608 to 1386) which 
span  the protein coding region of the wild type OAT  mRNA (12). 
The products of the RNase protection reaction were separated  on  a 
6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (23) and  their size was used to 
predict the location of the mismatched bases. 
Single Strand Conformational Polymorphism (SSCP) 
SSCP analysis was performed on the products of PCR amplifica- 
tion of OAT exons plus flanking splice sequences from genomic DNA 
as described by Orita  et al. (24) with the modification that 
dATP  and  [a-35S]dCTP were incorporated during the amplification 
reaction. 
Confirmation of Mutations 
Any  exon with a  putative  mutation was amplified at least twice 
and sequenced in  both directions. The presence of a  mutation was 
confirmed in genomic  DNA by demonstration of a restriction site 
alteration, if this was a predicted result of the mutation,  and/or by 
allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to slot-blotted  products 
of additional PCR amplification of the genomic  DNA of the proband 
and other available members of the pedigree (25,26). 
Mutant cDNA Construction 
cDNA Subclones from GA Patient Fibroblast RNA-Mutant OAT 
cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of patient fibroblast 
RNA (12). DNA cassettes  containing the mutations R180T, A184A, 
and L402P were synthesized by PCR amplification of the relevant 
region of the appropriate cDNA as described (20). The amplified 
PCR products were digested at unique restriction sites flanking the 
mutation. The  mutant cassette was gel purified in  a 2% low melting 
point agarose gel (BRL), excised, and subcloned into  the correspond- 
ing region of phuOAT6. The presence of the mutation and  the absence 
of any other alterations was confirmed by sequencing the entire region 
corresponding to  the  mutant cassette and cloning restriction  sites  in 
the recombinant mutant clone. 
Cloning of Mutations by Site-directed Mutagenesis-DNA cassettes 
containing MlI, R154L,  R271K, P417L, and L437F  were constructed 
by site-directed mutagenesis. Oligonucleotides containing the desired 
mutation (18 to 56-mers) were synthesized. In  the case of M1I and 
P417L, both the mutation and a nearby unique restriction  site were 
included in the oligonucleotide. For each of the other  mutations,  a 
total of four oligonucleotides were synthesized (Fig. 1). phuOAT6 (10 
ng) was  used as  a  template for PCR (100  pl of reaction, Gene AMP

Kit, Cetus, see above). After initial  denaturation at 94 "C for 4 min, 
the amplification reaction cycled between 94 "C and  the predicted T, 
(T, = 4 "C per G or C nucleotide + 2 "C per A or T nucleotide) of 
the primer with the lower melting point using a 15-5 dwell-time at 
each temperature. After 25  cycles, the products were elongated at 
72 "C for 4 min. An aliquot (10 pl) of the reaction was electrophoresed 
on  a 5% agarose gel (3% Nusieve, FMC, 2% Type I, Sigma) and 
visualized with ethidium bromide to evaluate the amplification. To 
remove any nucleotides added beyond the template by Taq polymerase 
(27), we used the 3' - 5' exonuclease activity of Klenow fragment by 
incubating the remainder of the reaction mixture with Klenow frag- 
ment (6 units) and deoxynucleotide triphosphate (250 WM each) for 
30 min at 37 "C (23). The product was purified with Geneclean (Bio 
101), eluted, and  the 5' ends phosphorylated with polynucleotide 
kinase (15-20 units,  as directed by the supplier, Boehringer Mann- 
heim). The reaction mixture was diluted to 50  pl with H,O and  a 20- 
pl aliquot digested with appropriate restriction enzymes. Fragments 
of the correct size were  gel purified in 2% low melting point agarose 
and subcloned into  the appropriate  site of phuOAT6. 
For mutations which  were not within 50 bp of a unique restriction 
site (R154L, R271K, and L437F), the  mutant cDNAs  were con- 
structed  as  a  two-part  cassette with left and right arms (Fig. 1). The 
desired mutation was incorporated into one of the two oligonucleo- 
tides which form the junction between the arms of the cassette (27). 
A triple ligation (vector-unique site 1-left arm-blunt-right arm-unique 
site 2-vector) was required to generate the complete mutant cassette 
which was then ligated into  the corresponding sites of phuOAT6. To 
confirm that  the desired mutation was the only alteration introduced 
into the huOAT cDNA, the region corresponding to  the entire cassette 
and the cloning restriction sites was sequenced. The full-length 
recombinant OAT cDNA  was  removed from pGEM4 with EcoRI and 
ligated into p91023b for expression. 
Transfections 
DNA transfection (28) was performed using as  the recipient cells 
(12) our NC5 subclone of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, CHO- 
K1, which lacks endogenous OAT mRNA, protein, and activity. 
Enzyme Assays 
Cell lysate OAT activity was measured radiochemically (29). A 
standard assay mixture contained 0.7 mM L-ornithine, 0.7 mM a- 
ketoglutarate, 16 pM pyridoxal phosphate, 0.1 M KPO, (pH 8.0), 0.10 
pCi of [3H]ornithine  (DuPont-New  England Nuclear), and 25-50  pg

of protein in  a final volume of  250 pl.  Following incubation at 37 "C 
for 1 h the reaction was terminated by addition of 6 N HCI (50 p]). 
Under these conditions, the reaction product, glutamate semialde- 
hyde, is converted nonenzumatically to A1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate 
which is separated from ornithine by ion exchange chromatography 
on disposable 1-ml Dowex  AG 50W-X8 H+ form 100-200 mesh 
columns. Activities as low as 1 nmol of product/h/mg of protein 
(about 1% that of control fibroblasts) are detectable. P-Galactosidase 
activity was determined as described by Miller (30). 
RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting 
Total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidinium isothiocyanate 
method (31), electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gels (23), 
transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N, Amersham Corp.), and 
hybridized with probes generated by random hexamer priming (19) 
of the desired template. 
Anti-OAT Peptide Antisera 
(KTVQGPPTSDDIFEREYKY) was synthesized on an Applied Bio- 
A peptide corresponding to residues 32-50  of human OAT 
systems 430A peptide synthesizer, and purified by reverse phase high 
performance liquid chromatography. The sequence of the peptide was 
verified with an Applied Biosystems 470A protein sequenator. A 
sample of the peptide (2 mg)  was cross-linked to keyhole limpet 
hemocyanin (4 mg) with glutaraldehyde (O.l%, 1 h,  room tempera- 
ture), dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.35), and  an amount 
of this cross-linked material containing 150 pg  of peptide was  mixed 
with 2 ml  of complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) and injected sub- 
cutaneously into a 2-kg rabbit. Two intramuscular booster injections 
(50 pg  of cross-linked peptide in incomplete Freund's adjuvant) were 
administered 4 and 8 weeks after the initial injection. Serum was 
collected 10 days after the first boost and  at 2-week intervals  there- 
after. Preimmune serum was  used as a control for immunoblots. We 
verified the specificity of the antibody by demonstrating that  it 
identified a 45-kDa protein  in  control fibroblast and liver homoge- 
nates which  was absent  in fibroblast extracts from a GA patient who 
lacked detectable OAT mRNA (data not shown). 
Immunoblots 
Cell sonicates (25-50  pg  of protein) were subjected to sodium 
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (32) and electro- 
blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Milli- 
pore). Immunoblots were performed exactly as described (33) utilizing 
anti-OAT peptide antiserum (1/500 dilution). 
RESULTS 
Mutation Detection-In the genomic DNA of  GA patients 
we found 25 mutations  in the 24 OAT mutant alleles listed in 
Table I. One allele, P417L/L437F, has two missense muta- 
tions in cis. Nine of the  mutations  (MlI, Y55H, C93F, R154L, 
R180T, A184A, A270P, R271K, and R396ter) were first local- 
ized to a specific region of the cDNA using the RNase  A 
protection technique. The exact  mutation was then  deter- 
mined by sequencing PCR products amplified either from 
genomic DNA or from cDNA synthesized from fibroblast 
RNA. Nine  mutations ((N89K, I127fs(+l), P241L, R250P, 
T2671, E318fs(-1), G353D,  C394R, and  G40lter)) were local- 
ized to a  particular exon by SSCP and identified by directly 
sequencing the products of PCR amplifications of the relevant 
exon. The remaining seven mutations  ((H53fs(-1), Y245C, 
N334fs(-l), G375A, L402P, P417L, and L437F)) were de- 
tected by sequencing PCR amplified OAT exons or cDNA, 
without prior localization. 
Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization or restriction 
enzyme analysis (in  those cases for which the  mutation  alters 
a restriction  site) was used to screen our patient population 
(82 probands) and a  panel of 30 unrelated  control individuals 
for 16 of the 24 alleles described hereim3 Aside from L402P, 
Screening for the following alleles has not yet been performed: 
H53f~(-1), 1127fs(+l), A184A, E318fs(-l),  N334f~(-1), G353D, 
G375A, and R396ter. 
which was present in 19 of  24 Finnish pedigrees, the  other 
mutant alleles were uncommon, being represented in only 
1-7  of the 58 non-Finnish pedigrees studied. In each instance 
the  mutant allele was found in a patient(s)  and not  in the 
controls (data  not shown). 
Consequences of Mutations  on Fibroblast OAT mRNA and 
Antigen-Elucidation of the consequences of mutations on 
fibroblast OAT mRNA, antigen, and activity is complicated 
by allelic heterogeneity. The majority of the GA patients are 
compound heterozygotes at  the OAT locus.  We  were able to 
determine unambiguously the consequence of a  particular 
OAT mutation on mRNA and protein phenotypes for 13 
mutant alleles for which fibroblasts from true homozygotes 
were available. Assuming no interactions occur between the 
products of each allele, a  correlation between genotype and 
phenotype was also possible in fibroblasts from compound 
heterozygotes when there was  negligible amounts of OAT 
mRNA and/or antigen.  When OAT antigen  and/or mRNA 
was present, it was not possible to evaluate the contribution 
of each allele to  the phenotype. With  these caveats in mind, 
Northern blot analysis of fibroblast RNA from GA patients 
with the 24 OAT mutant alleles is shown in Fig. 2A. The 
mRNA phenotype for 14 alleles was scorable: 10 produced 
approximately normal amounts of OAT mRNA, while in the 
remaining four, it was markedly reduced. The  other 10 alleles 
were found only in compound heterozygotes and  their mRNA 
phenotype was indeterminant. 
The immunoblot analysis of OAT antigen from these same 
24 alleles is shown in Fig. 2C. Two alleles, R154L and R180T, 
produce normal amounts of OAT antigen and 20 alleles have 
little or no detectable OAT antigen. Two alleles (Y55H and 
A184A) are unscorable. Thus,  the majority of these  mutations 
result in a  marked reduction of immunologically detectable 
OAT protein in cultured fibroblasts. 
Expression-All of the  mutations tested by transfection 
produced large amounts of OAT mRNA (Fig. 3A). At the 
protein level, transfection with wild type, R154L, R180T, and 
L437F OAT alleles produced a  similar  amount of normally 
size (45 kDa) OAT antigen (Fig. 3C). A small amount (-3%) 
of a slightly larger band (49 kDa) which may represent un- 
processed pre-OAT is also present. In support of this  inter- 
pretation,  the 49-kDa band is not observed in cells transfected 
with the M1I allele which, as expected, has no detectable 
OAT antigen. Despite the presence of a large amount of OAT 
antigen, in R180T or R154L transfectants, no enzymatic 
activity was detected. Thus,  the expression data fit well with 
the conclusion from fibroblast studies that both of these 
alleles yield inactive yet stable OAT protein. By contrast, 
L437F produces an enzymatically active protein similar to 
wild type, suggesting this mutation has little effect on OAT 
function. P417L, which we found only in cis with L437F, 
yields little OAT antigen and no OAT activity. We conclude 
that  in  the P417L/L347F allele, the missense mutation at 
codon 417 is responsible for the loss of OAT function. Three 
alleles, A184A, R271K, and L402P, yield a small amount of 
normally sized antigen which is enzymatically inactive. In  the 
fibroblast analysis, we scored two of these, R271K and L402P, 
as OAT antigen negative. This discrepancy between expres- 
sion following transient transfection and  patient fibroblasts 
probably reflects the much higher level of expression of the 
transfected OAT gene in the recipient CHO K1 cells as 
compared to  the endogenous gene in  cultured  human fibro- 
blasts (roughly 3-15-fold for protein and activity). 
DISCUSSION 
We have utilized several mutation detection methods to 
identify OAT mutations in patients with GA. Our choice of

OAT mutant alleles 
The nucleotide(s) position mutated (nt) refers to  the OAT cDNA (4) and  the nucleotide(s) alteration  is given. 
The observed phenotype of the allele at  the level of mRNA and antigen was graded as 0, undetectable; 1+, barely 
detectable; 2+, reduced levels compared to control; 3+, indistinguishable as compared to control; I, indeterminant, 
unable to be scored due to compound heterozygosity. The functional significance of each allele as measured by 
expression in  a transient transfection assay is designated as "+" if the  mutant allele inactivates OAT function; or 
as "-" if it has no effect on enzymatic activity. Functional significance was assumed for those mutations which 
disrupt the reading frame (RF). Functional significance was inferred (inf) for nonconservative missense mutations 
which  were not directly tested.

methods was influenced by several features of the OAT gene. 
First,  it is a relatively small autosomal gene (11 exons of 52- 
793 bp). Second, it is expressed in cultured fibroblasts, so that 
mutant OAT mRNA could be isolated and characterized. 
Third, by initial  Southern and Northern blot analysis in each 
GA family (data  not shown), we found  no large re- 
arrangements of the OAT gene. Therefore, methods of mu- 
tation detection with sensitivity adequate to detect  point 
mutations were required. 
For the OAT alleles reported  here we mainly employed two 
screening methods to localize mutations,  RNase  A  protection 
and SSCP. Although RNase  A digestion detects  many single 
base  pair mismatches (34), it requires large amounts of mRNA 
- -45kD 
and radioactivity and  has imperfect sensitivity since some 
mismatches are  not cleaved (34). We estimate that we de- 
tected approximately 50% of the OAT mutations  in the cell 
lines we studied by RNase A protection. Although the sensi- 
tivity of the RNase A technique theoretically could be im- 
proved by using each strand of PCR amplified cDNA as  the 
target sequence, we have largely abandoned this method in 
favor of SSCP analysis of amplified exons. This  latter tech- 
nique has proved to be simpler and more sensitive (35). 
All the OAT mutations described in this report (summa- 
rized in Table I) are subtle  alterations  in coding regions of 
the OAT gene. Most (20) are nucleotide substitutions, includ- 
ing 11 transitions  and nine transversions, while the remaining

five are small (1-3 bp) deletions or insertions. Of the  transi- 
tions, three represent CdT or GdA mutations at one of the 
26  CpG dinucleotide pairs  found in  the 1317-bp coding se- 
quence of the OAT gene. The  mutations  are distributed 
throughout the OAT protein and have various consequences 
on  the primary  amino acid sequence. The majority (18/25) 
are missense mutations: four are frameshifts;  two are  non- 
sense  mutations; and one is an in-frame deletion of a single 
codon. For 12 alleles (Y55H, N89K, C93F, P241L, Y245C,

(see "Experimental Procedures") is 
underlined. 
R250P, T2671, A270P, R271K, G353D,  G375A, and C394R) 
we infer the  mutation is pathologic because these alleles were 
found only in GA patients  and  not  in 30 unrelated  controls 
(60 chromosomes). For those missense mutations which we 
have not analyzed by expression studies, we cannot exclude 
the possibility that  the identified mutation is neutral  and  the 
functionally  significant mutation was undetected by our 
screening methods. However, the observation that 10 of these 
12 mutations  alter amino acids conserved between Saccharo- 
myces cereuisiae and  human OAT suggests that  the  mutations 
alter residues important for OAT structure  and/or function 
(see below,  Fig. 4). 
At the mRNA level most of the OAT mutant alleles have a 
normal amount of normally sized message. Four alleles, 
H53fs(-1), 1127fs(+l), E318fs(-1), and N334fs(-1), have 
markedly reduced levels of fibroblast OAT mRNA. In these, 
the open reading  frame is truncated  to 77, 384,983, and 1065 
nucleotides, respectively, in  contrast  to  the 1317-bp open 
reading  frame of wild type OAT. These  truncated open read- 
ing  frames end  in exons 3,  4, 9, and 10, respectively, as 
compared to wild type OAT, which terminates  translation in 
the  11th exon. One allele, R396ter, terminates  translation 
prematurely but still in exon 11 and  has normal amounts of 
OAT mRNA (G40lter could not be scored because it is present 
in a compound heterozygote). Thus,  as  has been observed in 
@-globin (36), dihydrofolate reductase  (37), and triose-phos- 
phate isomerase (38), premature  termination  in  the  terminal 
exon of OAT seems to have no effect on mRNA levels but 
termination in the  penultimate exon or earlier is associated 
with markedly reduced levels of mRNA. 
The most common phenotype of the OAT mutation at  the 
protein level is a lack of immunoreactive OAT peptide. Of the 
20 alleles (10 in homozygous individuals) with normal 
amounts of OAT mRNA, two (10%) have normal amounts of 
OAT  antigen. The remainder have little or no  detectable OAT 
antigen.  Interestingly, 12 of these 20 alleles have simple 
missense mutations. With  the caveat that absence of OAT 
protein is defined as a  failure to react  with an antipeptide 
antibody, we tentatively classify these  13 alleles as protein 
destabilizing missense mutations. Destabilizing mutations 
often  result  in the disruption of hydrophobic and electrostatic

Ornithine 6-Aminot~ 
interactions within the  protein core (39). Ten of these desta- 
bilizing missense mutations (N89K, P241L, Y245C,  A270P, 
R271K, G353D,  G375A,  C393R, L402P, and P417L) effect 
residues conserved between S. cerevisiae (40), rat  and  human 
OAT (Fig. 4). The two mutations altering nonconserved res- 
idues (A270P and R250P) both involve proline. This imino 
acid forms the least flexible peptide bond (41) so it is not 
surprising that substitution by proline at these  positions 
would be deleterious to OAT structure (39). The importance 
of  A270 is reinforced by the observation that even a conserv- 
ative substitution at  the next residue (R271K) produces an 
OAT  antigen negative phenotype. 
Two of the missense OAT mutations, R180T and R154L, 
completely inactivate OAT function  without reducing OAT 
antigen, In  other enzymes whose structure is better under- 
stood,  mutations which alter function  without an effect on 
stability  often involve residues that participate  in the active 
site  (39,42,43). R180 and R154 are conserved in S. cerevisiae 
OAT. We speculate that  these residues may be involved in 
the active site of OAT. 
Curiously, one allele, P417L/L437F, has two missense mu- 
tations in cis as shown by sequencing PCR-generated cDNA 
clones and pedigree analysis (data not  shown). Two missense 
mutations  in cis have been described in  an allele for glycoas- 
paraginase and  an allele for glucocerebrosidase, the genes 
affected in aspartylglucoseaminuria (44) and Gaucher disease 
(45), respectively. To determine if P417L and L437F were 
acting in concert or independently to cause OAT  inactivation, 
we cloned each separately and expressed them in transient 
transfection assays. The P417L mutation is mRNA positive, 
antigen negative, and activity negative; L437F, by contrast, 
had no discernable effect on OAT mRNA, protein, or activity 
(Fig. 3). These  results are consistent with predictions from 
the yeast human OAT homology. P417 is conserved while the 
residue in S. cereuisiae corresponding to L437 is  an asparate. 
The residues at codons 438 and 439  of the  human enzyme 
also have diverged as compared with those  in S. cerevisiae. 
This suggests that  alterations  at  the extreme  C terminus of 
the protein  are tolerated. We conclude that L437F is a neutral 
mutation while P417L inactivates OAT.

Note  Added in Proof-Since submission of this manuscript, we 
have had the opportunity to study fibroblasts from a patient homo- 
zygous  for the P417L/L437F allele. Our results confirm that this is 
an mRNA-positive, antigen-negative, activity-negative allele.
